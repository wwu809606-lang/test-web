## 3. Classroom Guidelines
- **Interactive Learning**: Use GeoGebra (to visualize calculus/geometry) and Jupyter Notebooks (to code math models).
- **Real-World Applications**: Case studies connect math to engineering, physics, and data science.
- **Personalized Support**: Weekly Q&A sessions and one-on-one feedback on assignments.


## 4. Course Features
- **Interactive Learning**: We use tools like GeoGebra to visualize calculus graphs, 3D models, and algebraic structures.
- **Real-World Applications**: Case studies on how advanced math applies to physics, engineering, and data science.
- **Personalized Support**: Weekly Q&A sessions and one-on-one feedback on assignments.


## 5. Assignments & Evaluation
- **Homework**: Weekly problem sets (10% of final grade) — submit via the course website.
- **Projects**: Solve open-ended engineering problems with math (30% of final grade).
- **Class Participation**: Includes discussions and in-class tasks (20% of final grade).
- **Final Assessment**: Comprehensive exam on all topics (40% of final grade).
