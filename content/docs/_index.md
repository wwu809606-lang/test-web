# Advanced Mathematics for Engineering I: Case Study - Course Introduction  
This course serves as a **practical, case-based companion** to the core course *Advanced Mathematics for Engineering I* (6 credits, 96 credit hours). It bridges abstract calculus theories (e.g., limits, derivatives, integrals) from the core course with real-world applications, equipping students to apply mathematical tools to solve problems in economics, engineering, physics, and daily scenarios. A key focus is fostering mathematical thinking in the AI era—guiding students to understand, verify, and leverage AI tools rather than merely relying on them.  


## 1. Target Audience  
The course is designed for **first-year international undergraduate students** from countries participating in the "Belt and Road" Initiative, primarily majoring in fields such as:  
- International Economics and Trade  
- Computer Science  
Prerequisites align with the core course: proficiency in High School Mathematics (algebra, trigonometry, basic functions).

## 3. Core Course Features  
### 3.1 Interactive & Customized Teaching Model  
The course adopts a student-centered approach driven by feedback:  
- **Weekly Feedback Loop**: Students submit a questionnaire by 9:00 PM every Wednesday to report learning difficulties, request focus topics, or suggest review materials. The instructor tailors Friday’s class content based on this input.  
- **Three-Segment Class Structure**:  
  1. *Case Study Session*: Introduce new mathematical concepts through real-world scenarios (e.g., cost modeling for phone plans, projectile motion analysis).  
  2. *Targeted Teaching Session*: Address student-submitted questions, dive deep into confusing topics, and clarify misunderstandings.  
  3. *Review Session*: Reinforce key concepts with practice problems and open Q&A.  


### 3.2 Scenario-Based Case Design  
All cases are aligned with the core course’s mathematical modules, covering diverse application areas to demonstrate practical value:  
- Algebra & Polynomials: Calculating the total area of a photo with a uniform-width frame.  
- Linear Functions: Modeling monthly costs for mobile phone plans (base fee + data charges).  
- Quadratic Functions: Analyzing projectile flight time and rocket maximum altitude feasibility.  
- Inequalities: Optimizing resource allocation between Research (R) and Development (D) with time/budget constraints.  
- Exponential Growth: Estimating the number of unique 21×21 QR codes and the time to generate them.  

Each case follows a logical flow: *Problem Setup → Mathematical Modeling → Solution Calculation → Practical Interpretation* (e.g., excluding negative time values in motion problems, as they have no physical meaning).  


### 3.3 Deep Integration of AI Tools  
Building on the core course’s AI focus, this course teaches students to use AI as a **mathematical aid** (not a replacement):  
- **GeoGebra**: A free, web-based tool for visualizing mathematical concepts (e.g., how adjusting parameters affects quadratic function graphs, geometric relationships). No installation is required; web/mobile versions are available (access: [geogebra.org](https://geogebra.org) or Chinese mirror: [ggb123.cn/geogebra.html](https://www.ggb123.cn/geogebra.html)).  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Enables symbolic computation (e.g., integral solving), data visualization (e.g., cost-revenue curves), and documentation of mathematical analysis (mixes text, LaTeX, code, and plots).  
- Guiding Principle: Students first master mathematical principles, then use AI tools to verify results, improve efficiency, and avoid "blind trust" in AI outputs (e.g., identifying AI errors in derivative calculations).  


## 4. Learning Support & Resources  
### 4.1 Instructor & TA Support  
- **Office Hours**: The instructor holds weekly office hours (Tuesday, 2:00 PM–4:00 PM, R1-2083) for one-on-one guidance on mathematical concepts, case-solving strategies, and AI tool usage.  
- **TA Assistance**: Wenjun Wu provides support for:  
  - Understanding course materials and solving practice problems.  
  - Refining learning notes to track mathematical thinking progress.  


### 4.2 Learning Materials  
- **Core Tools**: Access links for GeoGebra and Jupyter Notebook (with setup guides) are shared via the course website.  
- **Supplementary Resources**: Lecture slides (PDF), extended case exercises, AI tool user manuals, and references to the core course’s textbook (*Calculus (7th Edition)* by James Stewart) and the University of Notre Dame’s MATH 10550 course materials (for theoretical reinforcement).  


## 5. Assessment & Incentives  
The course uses **continuous assessment** (no final exam) to evaluate learning engagement and skill development. Key components include:  
- Attendance: Regular participation is required (absences beyond a set limit may result in course failure).  
- Class Performance: Evaluated based on active participation (questions, discussions), quality of answers, and completion of in-class exercises.  
- Quizzes: Three quizzes (Weeks 6, 11, 16) to check progress; only the top scores are considered.  
- Learning Notes: Documentation of problem-solving processes, error analysis, learning strategies, and personal insights (reflecting growth in mathematical thinking).  

### Incentive: "Cat-Petting Coupon"  
A term-end reward is given to students with the highest weighted score (combining core course and case study performance), encouraging comprehensive mastery of theory and practice.  


## 6. Course Value  
- **Bridge Theory and Practice**: Translates core course theories into actionable problem-solving skills, preparing students for advanced coursework (e.g., economic modeling, computer algorithms) and professional challenges.  
- **Build AI-Era Competitiveness**: Helps students distinguish themselves as "AI architects" (who understand mathematical fundamentals behind AI) rather than just "AI operators" (who only use tools), enhancing employability in data-driven fields.  
- **Foster Critical Thinking**: Teaches students to interpret mathematical results in real-world contexts (e.g., distinguishing valid/invalid solutions), emphasizing that mathematics serves practical needs.
