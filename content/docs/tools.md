## Solving Equations with GeoGebra

### 1. **Linear Equations**
Linear equations of the form $ax + b = 0$ can be solved by graphing the function and finding where it intersects the x-axis.

#### Example:
Solve $2x - 4 = 0$.

- **Input**: Type `2x - 4` in the input bar
- **Solution**: GeoGebra will graph the line $y = 2x - 4$
- The x-intercept (where the line crosses the x-axis) gives the solution: $x = 2$

### 2. **Quadratic Equations**
For quadratic equations like $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, GeoGebra can find the roots by graphing the parabola and identifying x-intercepts.

#### Example:
Solve $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$.

- **Input**: Type `x^2 - 5x + 6` in the input bar
- **Solution**: The parabola intersects the x-axis at $x = 2$ and $x = 3$
- These are the two solutions to the equation

### 3. **Systems of Equations**
GeoGebra excels at solving systems of equations by finding the intersection points of multiple graphs.

#### Example:
Solve the system:
$$\begin{cases}
y = 2x + 1 \\
y = -x + 4
\end{cases}$$

- **Input**: Enter both equations separately
- **Solution**: The intersection point $(1, 3)$ represents the solution where $x = 1$ and $y = 3$

### 4. **Using the CAS (Computer Algebra System)**
GeoGebra's CAS view can solve equations algebraically without graphing.

- Open the CAS view
- Type `Solve[x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0, x]`
- GeoGebra returns: $\{x = 2, x = 3\}$

## Solving Inequalities with GeoGebra

### 1. **Linear Inequalities**
For inequalities like $ax + b > 0$, GeoGebra shades the region where the inequality is satisfied.

#### Example:
Solve $2x - 4 > 0$.

- **Input**: Type `2x - 4 > 0` in the input bar
- **Solution**: GeoGebra shades the region where $x > 2$
- The shaded area represents all values that satisfy the inequality

### 2. **Quadratic Inequalities**
Quadratic inequalities like $ax^2 + bx + c > 0$ are visualized by shading regions above or below the parabola.

#### Example:
Solve $x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0$.

- **Input**: `x^2 - 5x + 6 > 0`
- GeoGebra will shade the regions where the parabola lies above the x-axis, showing the solution set

### 3. **Compound Inequalities**
GeoGebra can handle compound inequalities like $2 < x \leq 5$. The solution is displayed as a section of the number line between the two bounds.

#### Example:
Solve $2 < x \leq 5$.

- **Input**: `2 < x <= 5`
- GeoGebra will shade the region between 2 and 5, including 5, showing the solution set

### 4. **Irrational Inequalities**
For irrational inequalities, like $\sqrt{x} < 3$, GeoGebra can graph the inequality and display the solution set.

#### Example:
Solve $\sqrt{x} < 3$.

- **Input**: `sqrt(x) < 3`
- GeoGebra will shade the region to the left of $x = 9$, showing the solution set $x < 9$
