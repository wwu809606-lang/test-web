Review binomial expansion patterns and link each term to an area piece. Scenario # A photo is 15 cm by 10 cm. A wooden frame of uniform width x (cm) is added around it. Find and interpret the total area as x varies. Assumptions and Variables # L = 15 (photo length, cm), W = 10 (photo width, cm), x ≥ 0 (frame width, cm). Outer rectangle dimensions: length L + 2x, width W + 2x. Key Formulas to Recall # Distributive law: (a(b + c) = ab + ac) FOIL (binomial product): ((A + B)(C + D) = AC + AD + BC + BD) Binomial square (reference): ((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2) Model Setup # Total area as product (before expansion): [A(x) = (L + 2x)(W + 2x)] Substitute L = 15, W = 10: [A(x) = (15 + 2x)(10 + 2x)] Algebraic Expansion (Step-by-Step) # Apply FOIL: [(15 + 2x)(10 + 2x) = 15 \\cdot 10 + 15 \\cdot (2x) + (2x) \\cdot 10 + (2x)\\cdot(2x)] Simplify terms: [A(x) = 150 + 30x + 20x + 4x^2] Combine like terms: [A(x) = 4x^2 + 50x + 150] Geometric Decomposition (Area Meaning of Each Term) # Original photo area: [A_{\\text{photo}} = L \\cdot W = 150] Top and bottom strips (two rectangles each L by x): [A_{\\text{top+bottom}} = 2 \\cdot L \\cdot x = 30x] Left and right strips (two rectangles each W by x): [A_{\\text{left+right}} = 2 \\cdot W \\cdot x = 20x] Four corner squares (each x by x): [A_{\\text{corners}} = 4x^2] Sum of parts (matches product form): [A_{\\text{sum}}(x) = 150 + 30x + 20x + 4x^2 = 4x^2 + 50x + 150] Units and Interpretation # All areas in cm²; x in cm. As x increases, the quadratic term (4x^2) dominates, so total area grows faster than linearly. Quick Checks # No frame (x = 0): [A(0) = 150] Thin frame (x = 1): [A(1) = 4\\cdot 1^2 + 50\\cdot 1 + 150 = 204] Consistency check with outer dimensions at x = 1: (17 \\times 12 = 204). Common Pitfalls # Outer dimensions add 2x (both sides), not x: use L + 2x, W + 2x. Missing a cross term in FOIL (30x or 20x). Mixing units (keep cm and cm² consistent). Extension (Binomial Square Connection) # If the photo were a square with side s, then outer side is (s + 2x), and: [A(x) = (s + 2x)^2 = s^2 + 4sx + 4x^2] Compare with the rectangular case: (4sx) is split into (2Lx + 2Wx). Self-Study Suggestions (Visualization and Tools) # Use GeoGebra or Desmos to: Create a slider for x and draw the inner photo and outer frame. Color-code the regions corresponding to (150), (30x), (20x), (4x^2). Display both forms simultaneously: product ((15+2x)(10+2x)) and expanded (4x^2+50x+150); verify they are equal for all x. Practice recognizing patterns: Re-derive ((a+b)(c+d)) via area composition. Try a square photo (s×s) to see ((s+2x)^2) visually. Case 2: The Phone Plan (Linear function; slope and intercept; units) # Purpose # Link a cost story to a linear function (y = mx + b). Interpret slope and intercept with units. Scenario # A phone plan charges a base fee of $20 per month plus $5 per GB of data. Assumptions and Variables # Let (g \\ge 0) be data usage (GB). Total monthly cost (C(g)) is dollars. Key Formulas to Recall # Linear function: (y = mx + b) Slope meaning: rate of change per unit of (x) Intercept meaning: value when (x = 0) Model Setup # Cost function: [C(g) = 5g + 20] Interpretation # Slope (m = 5): every extra GB adds ($5). Intercept (b = 20): pay ($20) even with (g = 0). Quick Checks # (g = 0): [C(0) = 20] (g = 6): [C(6) = 5\\cdot 6 + 20 = 50] Common Pitfalls # Forgetting units (GB, dollars). Misreading the intercept as “free usage” (it is the base fee). Self-Study Suggestions # Plot (C(g)) in Desmos/GeoGebra; mark (y)-intercept and show slope triangle. Create sliders for (m, b) and observe how line shifts/tilts. Case 3: The Thermostat (Compound inequalities; interval notation; number line) # Purpose # Translate verbal bounds to inequalities and interval notation. Practice number-line representation with open/closed endpoints. Scenario # A substance must be stored at “at least 18°C and at most 25°C”. Assumptions and Variables # Temperature (T) in °C. Key Formulas to Recall # Compound inequality: (a \\le T \\le b) Interval notation: ([a, b]) if inclusive; ((a, b)) if exclusive. Model Setup # Constraint: [18 \\le T \\le 25] Interval notation: [[18, 25]] Number-Line Graph # Closed dots at 18 and 25; shaded segment between them. Common Pitfalls # Mixing ≤/≥ with open circles. Forgetting the meaning of “at least/at most”. Self-Study Suggestions # Draw number lines for: (T \u0026gt; 18), (T \\ge 18), (18 \u0026lt; T \\le 25) and compare symbols to open/closed dots. Case 4: The Break-Even Point (Linear equations; intersection meaning) # Purpose # Use a linear equation to find when two models balance. Interpret the solution as a real decision point. Scenario # Machine cost ($300); variable cost ($5) per item; sell price ($20) per item. Assumptions and Variables # Items produced/sold: (x \\ge 0). Key Formulas to Recall # Solve (ax + b = cx + d) by moving terms. Intersection meaning: where two lines cross. Model Setup # Cost: [\\text{Cost}(x) = 5x + 300] Revenue: [\\text{Revenue}(x) = 20x] Break-even: (\\text{Cost} = \\text{Revenue}) [5x + 300 = 20x] Solution # Rearranging: [300 = 15x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 20] Interpretation # Sell 20 items to cover all costs; graphically, two lines intersect at ((20, 400)). Common Pitfalls # Forgetting fixed cost. Solving but not interpreting the units. Self-Study Suggestions # Plot both lines; mark the intersection; vary the sell price and see how break-even shifts. Case 5: The Projectile’s Flight (Factoring; roots as event times) # Purpose # Connect factoring with finding meaningful event times (height crossing zero). Review GCF and trinomial factoring. Scenario # Height model (h(t) = -5t^2 + 20t + 25) (meters), (t) in seconds. When does the ball hit the ground? Assumptions and Variables # Ground is (h = 0); (t \\ge 0). Key Formulas to Recall # GCF factoring. Trinomial factoring: (x^2 + bx + c = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)) when possible. Zero-product property. Model Setup # Solve: [-5t^2 + 20t + 25 = 0] Factoring Steps # Factor GCF (-5): [-5(t^2 - 4t - 5) = 0] Factor trinomial: [t^2 - 4t - 5 = (t - 5)(t + 1)] Roots: [t = 5,; t = -1] Interpretation # Physical time: (t = 5) s (ignore negative time). Common Pitfalls # Dropping the negative sign when factoring. Keeping unphysical roots. Self-Study Suggestions # Verify by graphing (h(t)); mark zeros and vertex; check symmetry around (t=2.5). Case 6: Can the Rocket Reach? (Discriminant; feasibility without full solve) # Purpose # Use the discriminant to decide reachability. Interpret 0/1/2 solutions as touch/cross/no-cross. Scenario # (h(t) = -5t^2 + 50t). Can it reach 125 m? 130 m? Assumptions and Variables # (t \\ge 0). Key Formulas to Recall # Discriminant: (\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac) Meanings: (\\Delta \u0026gt; 0) two roots; (\\Delta = 0) one (tangent); (\\Delta \u0026lt; 0) none. Model Setup and Checks # For (125) m: [-5t^2 + 50t = 125 \\Rightarrow t^2 - 10t + 25 = 0] [\\Delta = (-10)^2 - 4\\cdot 1 \\cdot 25 = 0] For (130) m: [-5t^2 + 50t = 130 \\Rightarrow t^2 - 10t + 26 = 0] [\\Delta = 100 - 104 = -4] Interpretation # 125 m: just reaches the peak (one time). 130 m: never reaches (no real time). Common Pitfalls # Sign errors in (b) and (c). Forgetting that (\\Delta) decides feasibility before solving. Self-Study Suggestions # Plot (h(t)) and horizontal lines (y=125,130); observe intersections. Case 7: Average Production Cost (Rational expression; long-term behavior) # Purpose # Derive a rational expression from a per-unit average. Understand limiting behavior as (x) grows. Scenario # Total cost (C(x) = 2x + 1000) dollars for (x) units. Assumptions and Variables # (x \u0026gt; 0) (cannot divide by zero). Key Formulas to Recall # Average cost: (A(x) = \\frac{C(x)}{x}) Simplify by splitting the fraction. Model Setup # Average cost: [A(x) = \\frac{2x + 1000}{x} = 2 + \\frac{1000}{x}] Interpretation # As (x \\to \\infty), (A(x) \\to 2). Domain excludes (x = 0); vertical asymptote in the graph. Common Pitfalls # Forgetting domain (x \u0026gt; 0). Misreading (1000/x) at small (x) (it is large). Self-Study Suggestions # Graph (A(x)); mark asymptote and observe approach to 2. Case 8: The Profitable Window (Quadratic inequality; sign diagram) # Purpose # Find where a quadratic is positive (profit). Practice critical values and sign testing. Scenario # Profit (P(x) = -0.1x^2 + 20x - 300). For which (x) is (P(x) \u0026gt; 0)? Assumptions and Variables # (x \\ge 0) (items count). Key Formulas to Recall # Solve inequality by roots + sign diagram. For (a\u0026lt;0), the parabola opens downward. Model Setup # Solve (P(x) = 0) to get critical points (break-even). Suppose roots are (x_1) and (x_2) with (x_1 \u0026lt; x_2). Interval Test # Since (a=-0.1 \u0026lt; 0), (P(x) \u0026gt; 0) between the roots: [(x_1, x_2)] Interpretation # The positive interval is the “profitable window”. Common Pitfalls # Forgetting to test intervals or misordering roots. Including endpoints when the inequality is strict “\u0026gt;”. Self-Study Suggestions # Compute exact roots via quadratic formula; draw the sign diagram; confirm on a graph. Case 9: Budgeting Time and Money (Systems of linear inequalities; feasible region) # Purpose # Represent multiple constraints simultaneously. Visualize feasible plans as an overlapping region. Scenario # Research hours (R), Development hours (D). Time limit 30 h; budget ($500) with ($10/h) for (R), ($25/h) for (D). Assumptions and Variables # (R \\ge 0,; D \\ge 0). Key Formulas to Recall # Half-planes and intersection. Intercepts and boundary lines. Model Setup # Time: [R + D \\le 30] Cost: [10R + 25D \\le 500] Non-negativity: [R \\ge 0,; D \\ge 0] Graph Interpretation # Shade each half-plane; the polygonal overlap is the feasible region. Vertices (corner points) are important candidates if optimizing. Common Pitfalls # Reversing inequality shading. Ignoring axes constraints (R \\ge 0,; D \\ge 0). Self-Study Suggestions # Plot in GeoGebra; identify vertices; try maximizing a simple objective like (R + 2D). Case 10: Password Security (Exponential vs logarithm; orders of magnitude) # Purpose # Solve for an exponent via logarithms. Build intuition for huge counts and time scales. Scenario # Alphabet size 36; trials per second (10^9); target time 100 years. Assumptions and Variables # Password length (L) (integer). Key Formulas to Recall # Exponential count: (N = a^L) Logs to solve exponents: (L = \\frac{\\log N}{\\log a}) Product inside log: (\\log(uv) = \\log u + \\log v) Model Setup # Total guesses in 100 years: [\\text{Guesses} \\approx 10^9 \\times (100 \\text{ years in seconds})] [100 \\text{ years} \\approx 100 \\times 365 \\times 24 \\times 3600 \\approx 3.15 \\times 10^9 \\text{ s}] [\\Rightarrow \\text{Guesses} \\approx 3.15 \\times 10^{18}] Requirement: [36^L \u0026gt; 3.15 \\times 10^{18}] Solve with Logs # Taking logs: [L \u0026gt; \\frac{\\log(3.15 \\times 10^{18})}{\\log 36}] Estimate: [\\log_{10}(3.15 \\times 10^{18}) \\approx \\log_{10}3.15 + 18 \\approx 0.5 + 18 = 18.5] [\\log_{10} 36 \\approx 1.556] [L \u0026gt; \\frac{18.5}{1.556} \\approx 11.9] Interpretation # Need at least (L = 12) characters. Common Pitfalls # Mixing log bases; any base works if consistent. Forgetting to round up to the next integer length. Self-Study Suggestions # Compare results for alphabets of size 26, 62, or with a slower/faster attacker; plot (L) vs attack speed on a log scale.
